# # README.md for Challenge 6 - Quiz with Highscores

As per the assingment requirements, this web application is a simple quiz where the user is prompted with 5 multiple choice questions with 4 possible options - where only one of them is correct. Each correct answer is worth 10 points, so the highest score possible is 50.

At the end of the quiz, the user is prompted for her/his initials and then allowed to submit their score. There is also a highscores page where the previous scores are saved - all of these attributed with the users' initials at the time. 

The website can be viewed here: (https://joaod92.github.io/Challenge6Quiz)

Here is a screenshot below of the application:
